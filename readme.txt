Challenge-1: WordPress-Slideshow Plugin
This plugin will test if you are familiar with WordPress shortcodes.

Admin-Side:

Create an admin-side settings page.
Provide an interface to add/remove images from plugin settings page.
User must be able to change order of uploaded image. (Hint: Use http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#connect-lists )
Front-end:

Create provision for a shortcode like [myslideshow]
When you add shortcode [myslideshow] to any page, it will be replaced by a slideshow of images uploaded from admin-side.
You can use any jQuery slideshow library/plugin.
